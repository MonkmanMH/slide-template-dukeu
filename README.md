A slide template with the the Duke University Color Palatte

## Combines

* Xaringan slide library ([github](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) | [vingette](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan))
* [Duke University Color Palette](https://styleguide.duke.edu/color-palette/)

## Info:

My slide-deck template integrates the Duke University Color palette into the Xaringan slide package. Compose your slides Rmarkdown, knit, and your done. Now go present and deliver the Duke-wow. My next development step for this project is to further integrate the existing template into the Rstudio document template feature-set which will streamline your slide development even more.
